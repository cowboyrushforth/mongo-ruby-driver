    # Create a connection to a MongoDB replica set.
    #
    # Once connected to a replica set, you can find out which nodes are primary, secondary, and
    # arbiters with the corresponding accessors: Connection#primary, Connection#secondaries, and
    # Connection#arbiters. This is useful if your application needs to connect manually to nodes other
    # than the primary.
    #
    # @param [Array] args A list of host-port pairs to be used as seed nodes followed by a
    #   hash containing any options. See the examples below for exactly how to use the constructor.
    #
    # @option options [String] :rs_name (nil) The name of the replica set to connect to. You
    #   can use this option to verify that you're connecting to the right replica set.
    # @option options [Boolean, Hash] :safe (false) Set the default safe-mode options
    #   propogated to DB objects instantiated off of this Connection. This
    #   default can be overridden upon instantiation of any DB by explicity setting a :safe value
    #   on initialization.
    # @option options [:primary, :secondary] :read (:primary) The default read preference for Mongo::DB
    #   objects created from this connection object. If +:secondary+ is chosen, reads will be sent
    #   to one of the closest available secondary nodes. If a secondary node cannot be located, the
    #   read will be sent to the primary.
    # @option options [Logger] :logger (nil) Logger instance to receive driver operation log.
    # @option options [Integer] :pool_size (1) The maximum number of socket connections allowed per
    #   connection pool. Note: this setting is relevant only for multi-threaded applications.
    # @option options [Float] :pool_timeout (5.0) When all of the connections a pool are checked out,
    #   this is the number of seconds to wait for a new connection to be released before throwing an exception.
    #   Note: this setting is relevant only for multi-threaded applications.
    # @option opts [Float] :op_timeout (nil) The number of seconds to wait for a read operation to time out.
    #   Disabled by default.
    # @option opts [Float] :connect_timeout (nil) The number of seconds to wait before timing out a
    #   connection attempt.
    # @option opts [Boolean] :ssl (false) If true, create the connection to the server using SSL.
    # @option opts [Boolean] :refresh_mode (false) Set this to :async to enable a background thread that
    #   periodically updates the state of the connection. If, for example, you initially connect while a secondary
    #   is down, this will reconnect to that secondary behind the scenes to
    #   prevent you from having to reconnect manually. If set to :sync, refresh will happen
    #   synchronously. If +false+, no automatic refresh will occur unless there's a connection failure.
    # @option opts [Integer] :refresh_interval (90) If :refresh_mode is enabled, this is the number of seconds
    #   between calls to check the replica set's state.
    # @option opts [Boolean] :require_primary (true) If true, require a primary node for the connection
    #   to succeed. Otherwise, connection will succeed as long as there's at least one secondary node.
    #
    # @example Connect to a replica set and provide two seed nodes. Note that the number of seed nodes does
    #   not have to be equal to the number of replica set members. The purpose of seed nodes is to permit
    #   the driver to find at least one replica set member even if a member is down.
    #   ReplSetConnection.new(['localhost', 30000], ['localhost', 30001])
    #
    # @example Connect to a replica set providing two seed nodes and ensuring a connection to the replica set named 'prod':
    #   ReplSetConnection.new(['localhost', 30000], ['localhost', 30001], :rs_name => 'prod')
    #
    # @example Connect to a replica set providing two seed nodes and allowing reads from a secondary node:
    #   ReplSetConnection.new(['localhost', 30000], ['localhost', 30001], :read_secondary => true)
    #
    # @see http://api.mongodb.org/ruby/current/file.REPLICA_SETS.html Replica sets in Ruby
    #
    # @raise [ReplicaSetConnectionError] This is raised if a replica set name is specified and the
    #   driver fails to connect to a replica set with that name.
